> A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns. Its basic move is two steps forward and one step to the side.

> Determine the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way

> Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

> Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:

   > knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])
   > => You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:  

     [3,3]  

     [4,5]  

     [2,4]  

     [4,3]
